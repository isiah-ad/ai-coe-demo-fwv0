# AI PDF Monitor for FormsWorkflow

A smarter replacement for website watchers and manual form monitoring. Uses AI to automatically track, extract, and compare PDF forms across court and government websites.

## The Problem

Teams manually check websites or rely on basic uptime monitors to track form changes. This is slow, error prone, and expensive.

## The Solution

Coral automates the entire process:

- **Automated Monitoring** Continuously tracks PDF forms across jurisdictions
- **AI Powered Extraction** Uses OCR and LLMs to extract structured data
- **Change Detection** Instantly identifies updates, relocations, and missing forms

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
